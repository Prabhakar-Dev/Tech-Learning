# TYPE COERCION

## _Introduction_
Type coercion is automatic process that convert or conversion the type of value to another type.

## Implicit vs. explicit coercion
- Since JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, values can also be converted between different types automatically, and it is called `implicit type coercion`.
- When a developer expresses the intention to convert between types by writing the appropriate code, like `Number(value)`, itâ€™s called `explicit type coercion` or `type casting`.

```
String(123) // explicit
123 + ''    // implicit
```
