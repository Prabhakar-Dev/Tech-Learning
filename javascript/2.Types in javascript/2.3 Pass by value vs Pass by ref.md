# PASS BY VALUE VS PASS BY REFERENCE

## _Introduction_
The difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value is, pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of a value, whereas pass-by-reference does not. Instead of making a copy, pass-by-reference does exactly what it sounds like a value stored in memory gets referenced.


```
let year = 3;
let john = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 20,
  };
  
let changeYear = function(yearNum, student){
  yearNum = yearNum + 1;
  student.age = student.age + 1;
}

changeYear(year, john);
console.log(year); // output: 3
console.log(john.age); //output: 21
```

> **NOTE**: There is no pass-by-reference in JavaScript but when objects are passed, their heap memory address is passed as a value, As a result, any changes made to the object are done on the original object unlike in primitive type values.
