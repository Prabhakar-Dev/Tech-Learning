# CLOSURE

## _Introduction_
Closure provides access to the outer scope of a function from inside the inner function, even after the outer function has closed. It provides `Data Privacy`.

```
function sum() {
    let a = 0;

    function increaseSum() {
        return a = a + 1; // the value of a is increased by 1
    }
    return increaseSum;
}

let x = sum();
let a = 5;
console.log(x()); // 1
console.log(x()); // 2
console.log(a); // 5
```
