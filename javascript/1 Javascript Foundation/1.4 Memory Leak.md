# MEMORY LEAK

## _Introduction_
The JavaScript engine allocates memory when you create objects and variables in your application, and it is smart enough to clear out the memory when you no longer need the objects. Memory leaks are caused due to flaws in your logic, and they make way for poor performance in your application.
 
### _Type of memory leaks_
`Undeclared or accidental global variables` : A reference to an undeclared variable creates a new variable inside the global object. 
```
function foo(){
    this.message = 'I am accidental variable';
}
foo();
```

`Closures` : Closure keeps the outer scope variables referenced after it's execution.
```
function outer(){
    const largeArray = []; // unused array
    return function inner(num){
        largeArray.push(num);
    }
}
const appendNumbers = outer(); // get the inner function
// call the inner function repeatedly
for (let i=0; i< 100000000; i++){
    appendNumbers(i);
}
```
`Forgotten timers` : The reference to the object from the timerâ€™s callback stays active until the timer stops.
```
function generateRandomNumbers(){
    const numbers = []; // huge increasing array
    return function(){
        numbers.push(Math.random());
    }
}
setInterval((generateRandomNumbers(), 2000));
```
`Out of DOM reference` : Nodes that have been removed from the DOM but are still available in the memory.
```
let parent = document.getElementById("#parent");
let child = document.getElementById("#child");
parent.addEventListener("click", function(){
    child.remove(); // removed from the DOM but not from the object memory
});
```
