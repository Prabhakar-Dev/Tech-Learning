# JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME

## _Introduction_

The JavaScript runtime is a program that extends the JavaSciript engine and provides additional functionalities, so it can interact with the outside world.

__Below elements are present in Javascript Runtime__ :

`Javascript Engine` : 
   - The purpose of the JavaScript engine is to translate source code that developers write into machine code that allows a computer to perform specific tasks.

`Web API's` : 
   - The Web APIs are not a part of the JavaScript engine, but they are part of the runtime environment provided by the browser.
   - There are a large number of APIs available in modern browsers that allow us to a wide variety of things 
   - like Manipulate documents, Draw and manipulate graphics, Fetch data from a server.

`Callback Queue` : 
   - The callback queue stores the callback functions sent from the Web APIs in the order in which they were added.
   - Callback functions will sit in the queue until the call stack is empty, they are then moved into the stack by the event loop.

`Event Loop` : 
   - The job of the event loop is to constantly monitor the state of the call stack and the callback queue. 
   - If the stack is empty it will grab a callback from the callback queue and put it onto the call stack, scheduling it for execution.
