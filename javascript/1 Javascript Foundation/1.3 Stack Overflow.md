# STACK OVERFLOW

## _Introduction_
The call stack has a maximum size assigned. Stack Overflow occurs when the number of function calls added to the stack increases the stackâ€™s maximum limit. A classic example to cause such a situation is Recursion.

```
function recursion(){ 
    recursion(); //a function calling itself 
}
recursion();
```
