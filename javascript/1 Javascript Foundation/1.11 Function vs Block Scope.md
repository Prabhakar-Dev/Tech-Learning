# FUNCTION SCOPE VS BLOCK SCOPE

## _Introduction_
Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.

` Fuction scope` : When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function.

`Block scope` : A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.  To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.

```
function foo(){
    if(true){
        var a = 10;
        let b = 20;
        const c = 30;

        console.log(a)
        console.log(b)
        console.log(c)
    }   

    console.log(a) // var declaration variables has function scope.
    console.log(b) // ReferenceError: b is not defined
    console.log(c) // ReferenceError: b is not defined
}
foo();
```

> __Note__: 
    - Var is called as function scope that is if a variable is declared using var keyword it will be accessible throughout the function.
    - let & const are block scope.
