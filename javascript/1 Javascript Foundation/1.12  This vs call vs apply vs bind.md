# THIS - CALL - APPLY - BIND

`this` : 
- In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object. Which object depends on how this is being invoked.

`call` : 
- The call method binds the this value to the function and executes the function. 
- It takes the this value and a list of arguments as parameters. Then, it returns the value returned by the function, which is called using the call method.

```
function test(arg1, arg2){
    console.log(this.num, arg1, arg2); // 100, 10, 20
}
test.call({num: 100}, 10, 20);
```

`apply` : 
-  The apply method binds the this value to the function and executes the function. 
- It takes the this value and a single array object as parameters, and it returns the value returned by the function, which is called using the apply method.

```
function test(arg1, arg2){
    console.log(this.num, arg1, arg2); // 100, 10, 20
}
test.apply({num: 100}, [10,20]); 
```

`bind` : 
- The bind method binds the this value to the function and returns a new function. However, we still need to separately invoke the returned function.

```
function test(arg){
    console.log(this.number, arg);
}   
let bindedFn = test.bind({number: 100}, 10);   
bindedFn(); // 100, 10
```
