# CLOSURE

## _Introduction_
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created.

```
function main() {
  var name = "developer"; // name is a local variable created by main()
  function print() {
    // print() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  print();
}
main();
```

# _Advantages of closures_
- They allow you to attach variables to an execution context.
- Variables in closures can help you maintain a state that you can use later.
- They provide data encapsulation.
- They help remove redundant code.
- They help maintain modular code.
