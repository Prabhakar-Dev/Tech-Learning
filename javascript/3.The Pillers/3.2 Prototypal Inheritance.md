# PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE

## _Introduction_
Prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing `object constructor`. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype. Prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another.

```
let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    greet: function () {
        return "Hi, I'm " + this.name;
    }
};

console.log(person.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
```
