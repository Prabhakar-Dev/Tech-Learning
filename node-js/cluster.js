/**
 *  CLUSTER
 *  
 * ----------------
 * Intruduction
 * ----------------
 * Node.js, by default, follows the single threaded event loop based architecture.
 * Even if the computer has more than one CPU core, Node.js does not use all of them by default. 
 * It only uses one CPU core for the main thread that handles the event loop.
 * Node.js comes bundled up with a cluster module. Clustering is a great way to optimize your Node.js appâ€™s overall performance.
 * The cluster module permits the creation of child processes, that are copies of your app concurrently on the same server port.
 * 
 * ----------------
 * Use for 
 * ----------------
 * 1. Scalability - The application must be updated so as to support a large number of users and provide a good experience to all of them. 
 *                  Clustering acts as a load-balancing and parallel processing service.
 * 2. performance - Load is shared among the multiple cores of the application.
